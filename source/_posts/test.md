### Part 1: Who this is for & the "finished" product

This is a series written by a beginner, for beginners. Most of what I'm going to say here would probably get looks of disgust from anyone who is a compotent developer.

<!-- more -->

I will not pretend that any of what I'm about to tell you is 'best practice'. That being said, the following series is probably best suited for those who know some vanilla Javascript and have at least browsed through the [React docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/). You also might've thought something like this recently:

* _"I want to build something more than a clock with React"_

* _"I want a guided react-based project since I'm still too new to just run off and build something"_

* _"I sort of understand Javascript and React, but I don't get how all of these other things like webpack come together to make something"_

#### What we're building

I put together a simple page called [twitch.show](http://www.twitch.show) to help teach myself react.

#### What you'll learn 

In no particular order 

* Useful command line stuff
* Working with an API - from obtaining your token ID to rendering data on a page
* React 
* React Router
* Recharts (a charting library for React)
* Webpack 
* Babel
* ES6 stuff 
* Bad Bootstrap 

This simple page was immensely valuable for a few reasons.

##### 1. It's a lot more than just 'learning react' 

Learning react by itself is certainly okay, but it doesn't really become useful unless you understand the other tools that developers use with it every day. As you can see above, you'll be learning all the pieces to build a simple SPA with react from start to finish (and a little extra).

##### 2. My HTML/CSS  ~~is shit~~  foundation is not solid, so it was good to build something from scratch

If you're like me, you were excited to learn about Javascript and breezed through HTML/CSS. It seemed simple enough and you thought you'd "pick it up as you go". Well, this is you 'going' now, so do your best to envision a unique layout and then make it happen. 

##### 3. I changed it a ton

This is really the core of where learning happens. I hope that you don't create a carbon copy of this page, but decide to make it your own once you've got it up and running. This is also a great way to get more familiar with version control and pushing your changes to github. For me personally, I worked between my laptop and my home desktop, so it was almost like working with somebody else....almost. 


Let's get started.
